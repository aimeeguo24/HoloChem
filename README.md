 Problem: Labs are not accessible during difficult times (such as during a pandemic) and also in regions that lack educational resources. In addition, online simulations do not give students the complete chemistry experience because they lack the immersive, hands-on learning approach an actual chemistry lab has to offer.

 Our Solution: We created an Augmented Reality app that gives students who are unable to access lab materials an immersive, hands-on lab experience with three main components: **Hand Tracking** to let users manipulate virtual 3D objects with their own hands, **Eye Tracking** to determine if the user is reading the instructions, and **Spatial Mapping** to give users a similar experience to a real-world lab experiment

 This app utilizes Hololens2, Unity, and Visual Studio 2019.
